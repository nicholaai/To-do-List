The Meteor Tutorial app.

Use it to share a single todo list with your friends. The list updates on everyone's screen in real time, and you can make tasks private if you don't want others to see them.

Anyone can learn how to build this project. Check it out the [Meteor Tutorial](http://www.meteor.com/install).
